Why win_unc?
============

This library is for anyone who has tried to connect to or mount UNC paths in a Python
script on Windows. Understanding how to wield the `NET USE` command is a feat
in itself. Parsing its output programatically to know if your command worked is much
harder.

Fortunately, this library should make your life a lot easier.


Installation
============

To install:

    $ pip install win_unc


Getting pip on Windows
----------------------

Of course, installing `pip` packages on Windows is not always straightforward.
Here's how:

Download the [setuptools installer](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) for your platform and
run it. **Note that for 64-bit Windows, you need to download the `ez_setup.py` script instead of
the `.exe` installer.

Once you've installed `setuptools`, you need to add some paths to your system's `Path`
environment variable. You'll probably want to add paths like these:

  * `C:\Python27`
  * `C:\Python27\Scripts`

Then, in Windows command-line (`cmd.exe`), you can run the following to get `pip`
installed:

    > easy_install pip


Basic Usage
===========

Below is a simple example:

{% highlight python %}
from win_unc import UncDirectoryMount, UncDirectory, DiskDrive

conn = UncDirectoryMount(UncDirectory(r'\\home\shared'), DiskDrive('Z:'))
conn.connect()
print 'Drive connected:', conn.is_connected()
conn.disconnect()
{% endhighlight %}

You can also provide credentials like this

{% highlight python %}
from win_unc import UncCredentials

unc = UncDirectory(r'\\home\shared', UncCredentials('user', 'pwd'))
conn = UncDirectoryMount(unc, DiskDrive('Z:'))
{% endhighlight %}


Documentation
=============

UncDirectoryConnection
----------------------

The `UncDirectoryConnection` class describes how a UNC directory relates to the current
Windows sesssion. Use this class when you want to connect or disconnect a UNC directory. You can
also use it to determine if a UNC directory is connected or not.


### \_\_init\_\_

{% highlight python %}
UncDirectoryConnection(
    unc_directory,
    disk_drive=None,
    persistent=False,
    logger=no_logging)
{% endhighlight %}

This will construct a new `UncDirectoryConnection` object.

1. `unc_directory` must be a [UncDirectory](#uncdirectory) object which provides a UNC path and
   any credentials necessary to authorize the connection.

2. `disk_drive` must be `None` or a [DiskDrive](#diskdrive) object. If `None`, connecting this UNC
   directory will not create a local mount point. If a `DiskDrive`, connecting this UNC directory
   will create a local mount point at the drive letter specified by `disk_drive`.

3. `persistent` must be `True` if you want the UNC directory connection to persist across multiple
   Windows sessions. Otherwise, set this to `False` (the default).


UncDirectory
------------

The `UncDirectory` class describes the path to a UNC directory and (optionally) any credentials
that are needed to authorize the connection to the path.
