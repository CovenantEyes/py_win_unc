        In the method test_connect(...), we cannot call conn.connect() as this creates an error.
        The error is that the command line 'NET USE ...' fails with the given credentials.

        The correct testing approach would be to use the mock-object pattern and provide a mock-command-runner.
        This avoids calling the command line.

        In the interest of minimum changes, a different appoach is taken here:
         > A mock connection is created that does not use credentials
         > The mock connection will be listed when calling "NET USE" 
         > The actual connenction's entry in "NET USE" would be exactly the same as the mock connection entry
         > The is_connected() method checks the state listed by "NET USE"
         > By using the mock connection, we can "fake" the return value of "NET USE" to be exactly what it would be if the actual connection had been connected successfully.
