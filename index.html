<h1>Why win_unc?</h1>
<p>
  This library is for anyone who has tried to connect to or mount UNC paths in a Python
  script on Windows. Understanding how to wield the <code>NET USE</code> command is a feat
  in itself. Parsing its output programatically to know if your command worked is much
  harder.

  Fortunately, this library should make your life a lot easier.
</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>To install:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install win_unc</code></pre>

<h2>Getting pip on Windows</h2>
<p>
  Of course, installing <code>pip</code> packages on Windows is not always straightforward.
  Here's how:
</p>
<p>
  Download the
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools" target="_blank">setuptools installer</a>
  for your platform and run it.
  <strong>
    Note that for 64-bit Windows, you need to download the <code>ez_setup.py</code> script
    instead of the <code>.exe</code> installer.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Once you've installed <code>setuptools</code>, you need to add some paths to your
  system's <code>Path</code> environment variable. You'll probably want to add paths like
  these:
  <ul>
    <li><code>C:\Python27</code></li>
    <li><code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code></li>
  </ul>

  Then, in Windows command-line (<code>cmd.exe</code>), you can run the following to
  get <code>pip</code> installed:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt; easy_install pip</code></pre>

<h1>Basic Usage</h1>
<p>Below is a simple example:</p>

{% highlight python %}
from win_unc import UncDirectoryMount, UncDirectory, DiskDrive

conn = UncDirectoryMount(UncDirectory(r'\\home\shared'), DiskDrive('Z:'))
conn.connect()
print 'Drive connected:', conn.is_connected()
conn.disconnect()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You can also provide credentials like this
</p>

{% highlight python %}
from win_unc import UncCredentials

unc = UncDirectory(r'\\home\shared', UncCredentials('user', 'pwd'))
conn = UncDirectoryMount(unc, DiskDrive('Z:'))</code></pre>
{% endhighlight %}

<h1>Documentation</h1>
<h2>UncDirectoryConnection</h2>
<p>
  The <code>UncDirectoryConnection</code> class describes how a UNC directory relates to
  the current Windows sesssion. Use this class when you want to connect or disconnect a UNC
  directory. You can also use it to determine if a UNC directory is connected or not.
</p>

<h3>__init__</h3>

{% highlight python %}
UncDirectoryConnection(
<em>unc_directory</em>,
<em>disk_drive</em>=None,
<em>persistent</em>=False,
<em>logger</em>=no_logging)
{% endhighlight %}
